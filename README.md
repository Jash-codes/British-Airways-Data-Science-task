✈️ British Airways – Data Science Virtual Experience (Forage)

This project showcases my work from the British Airways x Forage Data Science virtual internship, where I solved real-world airline challenges using data science and machine learning.

🚀 Tasks Completed

🛫 Task 1: Lounge Eligibility Modeling
- Created a reusable lookup table to forecast lounge access eligibility (Tier 1–3) based on:
  - Route type (Short-haul, Long-haul, Domestic)
  - Region (Europe, Asia, North America, etc.)
  - Time of day (Morning, Mid-day, Evening)
- Provided assumptions and recommendations for future lounge capacity planning.
  
 🧠 Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict booking completion (`booking_complete`)
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Accuracy: 86%
  - ROC AUC: 0.77
  - F1 Score (buyers): 0.19
- Identified **flight_hour** as the most predictive feature.
- Built a one-slide executive summary for business impact insights.

 📁 Files Included
- `Task 1 - Lounge_Eligibility_Lookup.xlsx`
- `Task 2 - CustomerBookingModel.ipynb`
- `Task 2 - Summary_Slide.pptx`
- `customer_booking.csv` (Forage-provided)

 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization

 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Predictive modeling in aviation operations
- Data-driven customer targeting and personalization
- Real-world machine learning pipeline: data prep → training → evaluation → business insight
